I'm a <b><u>Machine Learning Research Engineer</u></b> at [Hi! PARIS](https://www.hi-paris.fr/), an AI research center founded by **Institut Polytechnique de Paris** and **HEC Paris** in 2020. My educational background is in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Data Science.

I have experience **conducting advanced projects** ðŸ’» in **NLP**, **Computer Vision** and **Generative AI** with researchers at Institut Polytechnique de Paris and HEC Paris, as well as **contributing to popular open-source packages**. <br>

I've lead the creation of **educational materials** ðŸ“š related to Python and Data Science for Hi! PARIS' data events, such as the Summer School, Data Bootcamp and Hackathon. 


### Contributions to open-source packages ðŸ“¦
- [POT](https://github.com/PythonOT/POT): A popular **Optimal Transport** open-source Python library (over 2k stars). I contributed by implementing the **low rank sinkhorn** and **low rank gromov-wasserstein**, memory-efficient adaptations of the OT solvers.
  - Example of low-rank sinkhorn [here](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/others/plot_lowrank_sinkhorn.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-others-plot-lowrank-sinkhorn-py)
  - Example of low-rank gromov-wasserstein [here](https://pythonot.github.io/auto_examples/others/plot_lowrank_GW.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-others-plot-lowrank-gw-py)
- [scikit-network](https://github.com/sknetwork-team/scikit-network): A popular **Graph Machine Learning** open-source Python library (over 600 stars). I contributed by developping **KCenters**, an adaptation of the K-means clustering algorithm to graphs using page rank to measure distances.
- [LowRankDensity](https://github.com/hi-paris/Lowrankdensity). A **probability density estimation package** developed by Hi! PARIS with researchers at l'ENSAE and Toulouse School of Economics. Main contributor to the package. I implemented the low-rank density estimators, resampling algorithms and 2D/3D density plots.
